## Quick Start

### Build
```bash
cd blockchain-java
mvn clean package
```

### Run Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

### Initialize Node
```java
// Create blockchain
Storage storage = new Storage("data", Config.STORAGE_AES_KEY);
PoAConsensus poa = new PoAConsensus(validators);
Blockchain blockchain = new Blockchain(storage, new Mempool(), poa);
blockchain.init();

// Access components
AccountState state = blockchain.getState();
SSIManager ssi = state.getSSIManager();
DeviceLifecycleManager lifecycle = state.getLifecycleManager();
BlockchainMonitor monitor = state.getMonitor();
```
